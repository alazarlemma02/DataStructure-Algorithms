     * What is time complexity?
     *
     * Time complexity is a way of describing how fast an algorithm is. It's a way
     * of measuring how many operations an algorithm needs to perform in order to
     * complete its task.
     *
     * There are two approaches of analyzing the time complexity of an algorithm:
     *
     * 1. Empirical Analysis => is a way of measuring the time complexity of an
     * algorithm by running it on a computer and measuring how long it takes to
     * complete its task.
     * Q. What do you think are the disadvantages of this approach?
     *
     * 2. Theoretical Analysis => is a way of measuring the time complexity of an
     * algorithm by counting the number of operations an algorithm needs to perform
     * in order to complete its task.
     *
     * And the method of describing how fast an algorithm is, is called Big O.
     *
     * What is Big O Notation?
     * Big O notation is a way of describing how fast an algorithm is. It's a way of
     * measuring time complexity.
     *
     * Prior to Big-O which is used to measure the worst case scenario, there are
     * other notations such as Big-Omega which is used to measure the best case
     * scenario and Big-Theta which is used to measure the average case scenario.
     *
     * ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€ Remember!! ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€
     * Big-O is used to measure the worst case scenario.
     *
     * When counting the number of operations there are rules that we need to
     * consider:
     *
     * ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€ Please try to read and familirize your self with the rules from your class slides ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€
     * ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€ Please try to differentiate between running time and growth rate of an algorithm ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€
