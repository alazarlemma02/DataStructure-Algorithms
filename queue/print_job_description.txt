 Problem: Print Job Queue

 Instructions

 1. PrintJob

    Create a simple class named `PrintJob` with the following attributes
        `jobId` (an integer representing the job ID
        `user` (a string representing the user submitting the job
        `numPages` (an integer representing the number of pages in the print job)

 2. StaticQueue

    - Implement a simple static queue class named `StaticQueue` for managing the
    print job queue
    - Use an array to store print jobs
    - Initialize the front and rear pointers to -1

    Implement methods

    - `enqueue(PrintJob job)` to add a job to the end of the queue
    - `dequeue()` to remove and process the job at the front of the queue.
    - `isEmpty()` to check if the queue is empty
    - `displayStatus()` to display the current state of the queue.

 3. Main Class

    - Create a main class (`PrinterQueueExample
    - Create an instance of the `StaticQueue` class
    - Enqueue a few print jobs, dequeue one job, and enqueue another job to
      demonstrate the basic functionality
    - Display the status of the print job queue after each operation.

Here is an example input and output

Input:
        PrintJobQueue queue = new PrintJobQueue();

        PrintJob job1 = new PrintJob(1, "John", 5);

        PrintJob job3 = new PrintJob(3, "Jack", 10);
        PrintJob job4 = new PrintJob(4, "Jill", 2);
        PrintJob job5 = new PrintJob(5, "James", 1);

        queue.enQueue(job1);
        queue.enQueue(job2);
        queue.enQueue(job3);
        queue.enQueue(job4);
        queue.enQueue(job5);

        queue.deQueue();
        System.out.println("First dequeue done.");
