     *                  Introduction to Searching
     *
     * Q. What is Searching and why is it important?
     * Searching is the process of finding a particular value in a collection of
     * values. It is essential for efficient data retrieval.
     *
     * Q. Storage Versus Retrieval when to be careful?
     * When we store data, we need to consider how we will retrieve it.
     *       ** If we store data in a collection, we need to consider how we will search for it.
     *       ** If we store data in a database, we need to consider how we will query it.
     *
     * When there is a need for fast and efficient retrieval of information,
     * especially in real-time or critical applications we have to be careful about
     * which searching algorithm we use. As the size of the collection increases, the time taken to search for a
     * particular value also increases. Therefore, we need to use an efficient
     * searching algorithm.
     *
     *
     *
     * In this weeks lab section, we will learn about two searching algorithms:
     *
     * 1. Linear Search
     * 
     * 2. Binary Search
